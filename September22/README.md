# Assignment 2 - Procedural Map Generation with Voronoi Tessellations

This Processing sketch generates maps (for use in games, Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, etc.) from Voronoi tessellations. This was a really interesting project to work on!

### 1. Voronoi Tessellations

To start, what is a Voronoi tessellation? Essentially, it's a plane partitioned into regions based on any given point's closeness to a given set of objects. For the purposes of this project, I randomly plotted points on the canvas, and generated Voronoi tessellations from those:

### 2. Generating Land

Now that we have our Voronoi diagram, we can select certain tiles from it to use as "land"! The reason this is nice is because instead of just drawing, say, a regular circle, a Voronoi diagram introduces some irregularity on shape borders. This makes the map a bit more realistic.

For this sketch, I drew an imaginary circle in the center of the canvas. Then, any of the Voronoi tiles whose points fell within that circle counted as "land". Here's what that selection would look like:

### 3. Prettifying

We now have quasi-realistic borders for our imaginary island, but it doesn't look much like an island. We can fix that by drawing the land tiles in green:

One thing to note about this project is that I didn't generate the points for the Voronoi diagram entirely randomly. Instead, I drew them in an even grid, then agitated them slightly to add more variation. In fact, we can see how the "smoothness" of the island borders changes based on how fine the grid is! Here's an example where I drew points in an 8x8 grid, which is much rougher:

And here's what the map looks like with a 50x50 grid, which is much more granular:

### 4. Map Features

We can now add more variation and character to our maps. First, I introduced a bit of randomness so that some "land" tiles would be converted to water tiles (like lakes or ponds!) and some water tiles would be converted to tiny offshore islands. That gives us this result:

Next, I want to fix the textures to resemble an actual map. For this feature, I used Perlin noise, which is a noise function built into Processing that is very useful for generating textures.
